# Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game made using Python programming language. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen and eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible and avoid colliding with the walls or your own body.

## Rules
The rules of the game are simple: you control a snake that moves around the screen and eats food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making it harder to maneuver. If the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game ends.

## How to Play
Use the keyboard directional arrows to control the snake's movement:

- Press the **up arrow** key to move the snake up
- Press the **down arrow** key to move the snake down
- Press the **left arrow** key to move the snake left
- Press the **right arrow** key to move the snake right

## Score
The game keeps track of your highest score. Once you die, it saves your score to a file named _data.txt_. This file can be found in the same directory as the game. The game also displays your current score on the screen during gameplay.

## Run the App
To start the app, use the command `python3 main.py` in your terminal or command prompt. This will launch the game and you can start playing right away.

Enjoy playing the Snake Game!
